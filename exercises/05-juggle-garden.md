# Exercise 05: Juggle Garden {

#### Grade
- 1.25% of final grade (see guidelines at bottom)  

#### Deadline
- Section A (Thursdays): 11:59PM, 29 October 2020.
- Section B (Tuesdays): 11:59PM, 27 October 2020.

## Objectives

1. Working with Object-Oriented Programming
2. Working with interacting objects
3. Working with input in OOP

## Set up

1. Download the `template-p5-project` and rename the folder to `exercise5`
3. Move the `exercise5` folder to your `exercises` folder
4. Open the `exercise5` folder in Atom
5. Commit and push in GitHub Desktop with a message saying "E5: Started exercise 5"

## Brief

Begin with either the final __Garden Simulation__ from the modules on Object-Oriented Programming or the final __Juggling Simulation__ from the Object-Oriented Programming Activity.

Think about ways you might want to change the meaning of the simulation you've chosen. Perhaps the flowers and bees could become yet another COVID-19 simulation. Perhaps the juggling simulation could become a parable about dealing with complex feelings. You can also just keep the same "story" for the simulation and think about ways to extend it.

Make your changes to the simulation with the following requirements:

1. __Add a(nother) form of user-control__
  - If you chose Juggling, add another form of control beyond the paddle (click to add balls? a keyboard controlled paddle?).
  - If you chose Garden, add a user controlled element (a user-controlled flower that moves? the user controlling a bee? a bird? the user as a god who can help flowers grow? planting flowers? the user as an aphid?)
2. __Add a new class and objects__
  - Add a new class and at least one instance of it in the simulation.
  - If you chose Juggling it could be different kind of ball? A chainsaw? (People juggle those right?) An AI paddle?
  - If you chose Garden it could be a bird, a slug, a cloud, a fairy?
3. __Add at least two endings__
  - Currently the simulation never ends, so make it end in at least different two ways
  - As per usual, you'll need states to do this (at least for the simulation and the two endings, you can add a title and instructions too if you like)
  - If you chose Juggling, maybe the simulation ends if all the balls fall down or if the user juggles some maximum number of balls successfully?
  - If you chose Garden, maybe the simulation ends if all the flowers die or if the user manages to plant enough flowers?

## Submission

Submission will take place on __Moodle__. Go to the appropriately named __exercise__ on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes (substituting your GitHub username and any difference in the folder names):

1. A link to your exercise code (e.g. https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253/tree/master/exercises/exercise5/)
2. A link to your project on the web (e.g. https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart253/exercises/exercise5/)

## Evaluation

Grading for exercises is pass/fail. Passing requires __all__ of the following to be satisfactory:

- __Runs__ and __meets the brief__
- Has __suitable commenting__
- Includes a __starting commit__ and then a reasonable number of commits throughout the work that include __descriptive messages__ about what was done. Messages should be __prefixed by `E5:`__.
- Uses __good naming__ for added variables
- Is __well structured__, with new code added in sensible places in sensible orders
