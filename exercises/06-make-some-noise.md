# Exercise 06: Make Some Noise {

#### Grade
- 1.25% of final grade (see guidelines at bottom)  

#### Deadline
- Section A (Thursdays): 11:59PM, 12 November 2020.
- Section B (Tuesdays): 11:59PM, 10 November 2020.

## Objectives

1. Working with p5.sound
2. Progressing the final project

## Set up

1. Download the `template-p5-project` and rename the folder to `exercise6`
3. Move the `exercise6` folder to your `exercises` folder
4. Open the `exercise6` folder in Atom
5. Commit and push in GitHub Desktop with a message saying "E6: Started exercise 6"

## Brief

The core objective of this exercise is to spend time both experimenting with the p5.sound library and its possibilities (most obviously playing with sound files, oscillators, synthesizers, and audio input) alongside achieving a milestone in your final project.

As such, you should ideally produce a **prototype** that explores how you will use **sound** in your final project. This should be a **stand-alone** prototype (not a submission of your entire project code to this point) and should focus on the relationship of sound to your work. It should be more sophisticated that simply playing some background music and the occasional sound effect, but doesn't have to be a work of procedural music genius. You could:

- Use microphone input to control how your user's avatar moves (if you have one)
- Use microphone input to switch between scenes or to change the visuals of your project
- Use a synthesizer to play musical notes when specific events take place or to play a song
- Use oscillators to create dynamic sound effects (lasers! sirens! heart beats!) when things happen in your code
- Use playback rate to dynamically play with sound files while your program runs to create mood
- And more!

If you simply cannot or will not include some kind of sound dimension in your final project, you should instead extend on the existing activity code for the **musical toy** and add in some new ideas, such as:

- Different kinds of balls (use inheritance) that have different musical qualities (they could use different oscillator wave forms in different ranges, they could play notes from different scale)
- Add a different kind of bouncing element that plays drum sounds (find kick and snare sound files for example, and play them when these elements bounce)
- Add visual effects when musical notes (or drums) are played, such as the ball briefly flashing a different color
- Allow the user to drag and "throw" the balls on the screen to gain more control of their composition
- And more!

## Submission

Submission will take place on __Moodle__. Go to the appropriately named __exercise__ on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes (substituting your GitHub username and any difference in the folder names):

1. A link to your exercise code (e.g. https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253/tree/master/exercises/exercise6/)
2. A link to your project on the web (e.g. https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart253/exercises/exercise6/)

## Evaluation

Grading for exercises is pass/fail. Passing requires __all__ of the following to be satisfactory:

- __Runs__ and __meets the brief__
- Has __suitable commenting__
- Includes a __starting commit__ and then a reasonable number of commits throughout the work that include __descriptive messages__ about what was done. Messages should be __prefixed by `E6:`__.
- Uses __good naming__ for added variables
- Is __well structured__, with new code added in sensible places in sensible orders
