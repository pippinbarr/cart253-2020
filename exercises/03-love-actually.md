# Exercise 03: Love, actually {

#### Grade
- 1.25% of final grade (see guidelines at bottom)  

#### Deadline
- Section A (Thursdays): 11:59PM, 8 October 2020.
- Section B (Tuesdays): 11:59PM, 6 October 2020.

## Objectives

1. Writing your own if-statements
2. Working with loops for drawing

## Set up

1. Download the `template-p5-project` and rename the folder to `exercise3`
3. Move the `exercise3` folder to your `exercises` folder
4. Open the `exercise3` folder in Atom
5. Commit and push in GitHub Desktop with a message saying "E3: Started exercise 3"

## Brief

Change the "looking for love" simulation from [Activity 05](../activities/05-looking-for-love.md). Ideally, you could think of how you want to change the meaning/nature of the simulation (maybe it could be about unrequited love? Or about unwanted love? Or platonic love? Or being a fan of a YouTuber? Or something else?). Make it __your__ simulation of love (or, if you like, change it to be about something completely different!).

Make your changes to the simulation with the following requirements:

1. __Allow the user to control one of the circles__
  - Anything goes, from clicking to position it, to having it follow the mouse, to using the arrow keys, to something else
2. __Make the non-user circle move differently__
  - Use random movement or Perlin noise or teleportation or something else!
3. __Add at least one extra function__
  - Not including functions any built-in p5 functions like `keyPressed()`
  - Maybe you could add a function that checks if one circle has grown too large (if they grow) or shrunk too small (if they shrink), or faded too much (if their alpha fades)
4. __Add at least one extra ending__
  - Maybe it could be an "easter egg" and hard to discover? (Moving the mouse to a really specific location?)
  - Maybe it offers a different dimension of thinking about love and loss?
  - Maybe it's connected to the new function in the previous step?

## Submission

Submission will take place on __Moodle__. Go to the appropriately named __exercise__ on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes (substituting your GitHub username and any difference in the folder names):

1. A link to your exercise code (e.g. https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart253/tree/master/exercises/exercise3/)
2. A link to your project on the web (e.g. https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart253/exercises/exercise3/)

## Evaluation

Grading for exercises is pass/fail. Passing requires __all__ of the following to be satisfactory:

- __Runs__ and __meets the brief__
- Has __suitable commenting__
- Includes a __starting commit__ and then a reasonable number of commits throughout the work that include __descriptive messages__ about what was done. Messages should be __prefixed by `E3:`__.
- Uses __good naming__ for added variables
- Is __well structured__, with new code added in sensible places in sensible orders
