## Structure

### OOP States

An example of representing your program's states using **Object-Oriented Programming** with **inheritance** and **polymorphism**. Reworks an earlier example of a simulation with a title, simulation, and ending. Probably the ideal way to represent your states.

## Graphics

### Clown chase

An example of combining **images** with **JavaScript Objects**. Two objects represented as different clown face images. The user controls one with the keyboard and the other one chases the user.

### Clown chase with Object Oriented Programming

An example of combining **images** with **Object-Oriented Programming**. Two objects represented as different clown face images. The user controls one with the keyboard and the other one chases the user.

### Clown chase with inheritance

An example of combining **images** with **Object-Oriented Programming and inheritance**. Two objects represented as different clown face images. The user controls one with the keyboard and the other one chases the user.
