## OOP and timers

An example of using `setTimeout()` in the context of a class definition specifically. Sadly, it doesn't "just work" the way you would expect because when `setTimeout()` calls a function it changes the meaning of `this` in that function. This example shows how to avoid this with the `bind()` method.
