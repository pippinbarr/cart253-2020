# Course Software

Here are instructions for getting your system ready to follow along with the core tools we use in the course.

## A browser

We use a __web browser__ to run our programs in this course. Any web browser is fine so long as you are able to enable the "developer tools". If you're unsure, just used __Chrome__ or __Firefox__. You probably already have one or both of these installed, but if not, here are the links to install them:

- Chrome can be downloaded at https://www.google.com/chrome/
- Firefox can be downloaded at https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/

## Atom

We use __Atom__ as our text editor. It's a nice, free, open-source text editor. Even if you prefer some other text editor, you should use Atom in CART 253.

1. Go to https://atom.io/
1. Download Atom to your computer
1. Install it by following its instructions

## Packages

One great thing about __Atom__ is that it's highly extensible with what it calls __packages__. The essential package we will use is called __atom-live-server__. It allows us to run a web server on our computer to try out our work efficiently.

1. Run Atom on your computer
1. Go to Preferences (on Mac OS X it's under `Atom > Preferences`, in Windows I'm guess it's in the `File` menu as either `Preferences` or `Settings`)
1. Select `Install` from the menu that appears in the editor
1. Type `atom-live-server` into the search bar
1. Click `Install` next to the search result called `atom-live-server`

When it has installed you should be able to go to the `Packages` menu at the top of the screen and see `atom-live-server` as an option there.

Repeat the same process to also install the package `prettier-atom` which will automatically format your code as you write it (good for style points!).

## GitHub Desktop

We will be using __version control__ as a central part of this course. To make our lives easier we're going to use __GitHub Desktop__ so we have a nice user-interface to version control.

1. Go to https://desktop.github.com/
1. Use the link to download GitHub Desktop to your computer
1. Install it

For now, __don't run GitHub Desktop__ as you won't have created your course repository, which is what we will use it for.

## Zoom

We will sometimes use __Zoom__ as a way for the whole class to get together live when needed. It is the dominant videoconferencing software at the moment and the one endorsed by the university.

1. Go to https://zoom.us/download and follow the download instructions

To use Zoom you will usually simply be emailed a link that looks something like

https://concordia-ca.zoom.us/j/1234567890

When you click the link your browser will try to open Zoom and connect to the videoconference. If something goes funny, you can also join a meeting by running Zoom yourself and entering the "Meeting ID", which is the 10-digital number at the end of the link above.

## Discord

We will generally use __Discord__ to communicate as a class. Discord is a fairly standard instant messaging, voice- and video-chat, and screen sharing application. To use Zoom it is best to have the application on your computer. You'll also need an account.

1. Go to https://discord.com/register and follow the instructions to register for a Discord account
1. Go to https://discord.com/new to download the Discord application for your computer
1. Run Discord and log in

You will be emailed a link to join the course Discord. Please don't share it with anyone outside the course.

## Summary

We now have the key software for this course.

1. We use a __browser__ (like Chrome or Firefox) to run our programs
1. We use __Atom__ as a text editor to write out programs
1. We use __GitHub Desktop__ and __GitHub__ to store our work in a repository
1. We use __Zoom__ for live videoconferencing when needed
1. We use __Discord__ as our home base for communicating about the course
